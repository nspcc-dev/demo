#### Series of introductory videos about NeoFS design
##### NeoFS Introduction - Episode 1: System Overview
In the first episode of the series, NEO SPCC provides a high-level overview of how the NeoFS system functions. 
Viewers can expect to gain a basic understanding of the network structure and how files are stored and retrieved by users.

##### NeoFS Introduction - Episode 2: Payments
The video provides an overview of how the NeoFS smart contract is used by users to deposit and withdraw GAS. 
The contract maintains account balances for all the GAS circulating in the network. 
The video also introduces the role of inner ring network nodes, responsible for monitoring and processing transactions on the network.

##### NeoFS Introduction - Episode 3: Placement, Migration, and Replication
In the video, users will learn about how data is uploaded to storage nodes in accordance with the placement function. 
This function calculates where an object should be placed based on the current network map and any user-specified conditions such as geographical location or disk type.
NEO SPCC also explains the migration and replication functions. Migration refers to data being moved around between nodes when the network map is updated, 
whilst replication is concerned with the restoration of data in the event that a storage node experiences a failure and loses its copy of an object.

##### NeoFS Introduction - Episode 4: Data Audit
Transferring large quantities of data in order to verify the integrity is an inefficient task, especially in a distributed environment. 
To avoid this issue and maintain the scalability of NeoFS, NEO SPCC opted to use homomorphic hashing as a method to prove the validity of stored data without needing to check the entire objects.
In the latest video, the team demonstrates how the system can detect corrupted files and also check whether a given storage node is lying about data it 
has stored by forcing it to play a data validation game with another node.

#### Conferences 
##### Consensus 2019
On May 14th, NEO St. Petersburg Competence Center co-founder Sergei Liubich presented the R&D teamâ€™s flagship project, NeoFS, at Consensus 2019 in New York. 
In the presentation, Liubich noted the requirements and issues present in the data storage market and demonstrated the functionality of the NeoFS distributed decentralized storage platform.
